# RDS usage - WIP

Deploy a mySQL RDS instance and use mySQL dbs stored in it through a local node.js application.

|------|---------|
| Time to deploy | 8 min (with backup) / (?) min (without backup) |
| Estimated cost | 0,03 â‚¬/h |

## Useful links

[AWS RDS site](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rds/index.html?nc2=h_ql_doc_rds)

## Usage

### Set db Credentials

Set user and password in `set_db_credentials.sh` script and than run it
```
. ./set_db_credentials.sh
```

Now you can deploy the db instance with terraform. Remember that at the and of the terraform deployment phase you have to copy/paste the `this_db_instance_endpoint` output variable (without the port number) in `dbsees.js` and `index.js`.

### Deploy RDS instance

To run this example you need to execute:

```
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Note that this example may create resources which can cost money (AWS Elastic IP, for example). Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.

### Set-up node.js app

Before to do this step you have to deploy an RDS mySQL instance.

If you do not have npm yet installed please follow this [guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Update `dbseed.js` and `index.js` with your RDS inputs (if you user the `set_db_credentials.sh` script you just need to update `<your-db-endpoint>`):
```
const con = mysql.createConnection({
    host: "<your-db-endpoint>",                  //Find this info in the db panel Connectivity&Security
    user: "<admin-name>",                        //The user name you defined during provisioning
    password: "<your-rds-instance-password>"     //The password you defined during provisioning
});
```
Run `dbseed.js` to create the table
```
node dbseed.js
```
You should get a message like this
```
OkPacket {
  fieldCount: 0,
  affectedRows: 0,
  insertId: 0,
  serverStatus: 2,
  warningCount: 1,
  message: '',
  protocol41: true,
  changedRows: 0 }
```
Now that you have created the main table you can run your code
```
node index.js
```
On your preferred browser, go to `localhost:3000/views`, you should see a screen like this (with zero rows because it is still empty)
