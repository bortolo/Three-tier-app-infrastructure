IMPORTANT TO CONFIGURE:
- name of the AZURE resource group on which run dynamic inventory (myazure_rm.yml)
- name of the user (we are assuming that all the hosts have one user defined with that name)
- name of the gitrepo (web is based on node.js app and app is based on .war file)
- Configure tags (jumphost=tag_environment_management, web=tag_environment_web, app=tag_environment_app)

NOTE: the last point is highly dependent on terraform provisioning.
